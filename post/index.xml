      <description>Setup a server with zfs and docker You are free to use this as you wish I am also using this as my own wiki to remember how to do stuff. I hope this can help other people.
I am going to set up a Digitalocean vps with docker and testing out zfs as docker storage driver.
I am going to use Ubuntu 16.04 since it have a native zfs binary.</description>

      <description>LXD setup I am now trying out LXC and LXD both are cool technologies. Lxd it is aÂ·
hyper-visor for lxc containers(linux containers).
So why LXD/LXC? That is a good question and it can have many answers.
It has benefits like being closer to the metal. And it behaves more like a
virtual machine and for me it is easier understand concept behind it.
Lxd is also more like Freebsd jails and the solaris zones.</description>
